# Data Engineering Git workflow



A clean commit log is an important component of a good code repository.  It aids
team collaboration by enabling each team member to quickly understand changes
that were made.  It also facilitates troubleshooting by making it easier to
find when and where bugs were introduced.  There are an innumerable number of
variations on git workflows in practice.  For Data Engineering at InsideTrack,
we use a version of a rebase/squash feature branch workflow (see
[here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow),
[here](https://randyfay.com/content/rebase-workflow-git),
and [here](http://reinh.com/blog/2009/03/02/a-git-workflow-for-agile-teams.html)
for similar workflows).
